<h1>Americans must choose their own president.</h1>
<p>written on Mar 22, 2016</p>
<p>From early February, I have followed Donald Trump in Twitter and Instagram, and often made pro-Trump comments. Some people have doubt if I am a disguised propagandist in an outreach office affiliated to the Trump campaign. Whoever will become the US president in 2017 doesn´t bring any benefit to me. And I am my own man. </p>
<h2>I am just following Trump, because there are common points shared between Trump´s manifesto and my book: <br>
  - gaping trade deficits with China<br>
  - exorbitant federal debt<br>
  - sovereignty of the US<br>
  - importance of the military for the US political and economic policy<br>
  - status quo of the US Establishment<br>
  (And some of Trump´s tweets are really funny.)</h2>
<p>Interestingly, my book was published in June 2015, when Trump started to run for the president. It´s just a coincidence by a quirk of fate. In this opportunity, I´d like to explain why the 2016 presidential election is much more important than any other previous elections in the US history. It will be helpful for the Americans to choose their own president.<br>
  <br>
In my post on Mar. 19, 2016 (Title: Inflation and the Euro), I expressed my eschatological view on the euro as a single currency.  The EU has not only made a botch-up of narrowing the North-South divide but also delivered belatedness in resolving the migrant crisis. The EU leadership doesn´t present a decisive and prompt solution economically and politically.</p>
<p>The UK will hold the referendum on Jun. 23 to decide to stay in or leave the EU. My Mar. 19 post expected that the EA will be beleaguered by the euro crisis in times of inflation. And the incompetent EU leaders will not be able to resolve the fraught situation. If remaining in the EU, the UK, in the end, will be the economic refugee camp for the continental Europe. The Jun. 23 referendum is the best opportunity for the UK to hedge against the pending insurmountable crisis. </p>
<p>Much to chagrin, both leaders of the Conservative and Labour Parties keep the pro-EU stance. There are bread-and-butter issues which are in need of being addressed urgently: food bank, zero-hour contract, NHS, housing in London. Those topics were febrilely debated during the campaign season in 2015. The ruling Conservative Party has not delivered the solutions, and the opposite Labour Party does not present the alternatives. To make it worse, the leaders of both Parties are speaking to the Britons staying in the EU is the best choice.</p>
<p>The pent-up feelings deep inside the British people are turning the EU referendum into a de-facto snap election to the Tories. If the result of the EU referendum turns out “leave”, the atmosphere will not allow David Cameron to stay in No.10. The biggest problem to the British politics is there is no better substitute to David Cameron. Where has the political vacuum come from?</p>
<p>I want to turn the clock back to the general election in 2010. Then the ruling Labour Party was defending the position against the opposite Conservative Party. The British media was standing on the front line to goad and coax the British public to depose the then Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. Based on the merits, Gordon Brown should keep the premiership. However, the media psy-op prevented the British public from being sober in making a decision, and generated the media´s own Prime Minister, David Cameron. The early exit of Gordon Brown has also paved the way to new Labour leaders, Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn. It´s the sequence of events from 2010 to 2016, which have brought about the political vacuum to the Westminster.<br>
  <br>
  Keeping the British politics in mind, let´s take a look at the 2016 US presidential election. The Republican Party started the presidential race with 17 candidates. When they drew the lineup, Donald Trump might have been placed as a shill to boost the popularity of the TV debates, and Jeb Bush might have been regarded as the presidential hopeful. Once the 17 candidates left the start line, the unexpected took place. Jeb Bush was never welcomed by any faction in the GOP voters, but Donald Trump has gained accolades all across the political spectrum in the grass roots. The people behind the political theatre, who want to make their own president and feel jealousy for Trump´s popularity, have organized the Stop-Trump movement. It´s the reason why we are watching rampant protesters in every Trump´s rally, abrupt occupiers on the streets and highways, esp. all-out media psy-op to excoriate and disparage Trump. </p>
<p>On Mar. 12-13, violence erupted in Trump´s rallies, and the media broadcast reports to attribute Trump to the source of violence. The media psy-op failed in distracting voters, and Trump won Super Tuesday on Mar. 15. Stop-Trump should realize the media cannot break the strong ties between Trump and the grass roots. Stop-Trump should also understand the Americans are expressing their pent-up feelings through the support for Trump. They are quenching their thirst for strength and identity of America with the support for Trump. Currently, Stop-Trump are carrying out multi-pronged approach to weaken Trump. It will be a futile attempt, because Trump´s popularity is not a flared-up frenzy. If they really want to take down Trump, Stop-Trump would rather be reassembled behind Hilary Clinton, looking for the general election.<br>
  <br>
  Trump delivers a new kind of political skills. His tactics are subliminal and surreptitious, and people do not understand what he is doing at the moment. His controversial profanity needs to be paraphrased as a political tactic, not a personal insult. If they really want to stop Trump, Stop-Trump should improvise a better strategy instead of organizing the protesters and writing the scripts for the media. Run-of-the-mill deception and threats can´t outwit the tactics of Trump. Recently, Neil Bush, Lindsey Graham, and Mitt Romney were bundled with Ted Cruz, looking for the contested convention. All the enemies are boarding a single ship. Trump can sink all of them with one round of salvo. No way.  </p>
<p>Election is a psychological warfare, not a beauty contest. The American voters need to consider which candidate executes better strategies to beat the opponents and win the election. Acumen and prowess in making a strategy to achieve a goal is the most important requirement for any political leader, esp. the president of the US. Let´s look at the current president, Barack Obama. He has a broad range of executive and political options to find out who are sending the protesters to the rallies and streets. But he is derelict in supervising the fair and sound election process. Otherwise, he is just claiming his right to appoint a Supreme Court judge. It´s the consequence, when the voters made a selection among the candidates like being a beauty contest. <br>
  <br>
  While writing a book, I studied all facets and layers of America at the levels of politics, economy, history, and religion, and managed to figure out the status quo of America and the stumbling blocks to her progress. I agree with Trump´s understanding on the problems and his approach to the solutions. First of all, the US must reduce the trade deficits and the federal debt, whatever they do. They raise the sovereignty issues. No country without currency and border.</p>
<p>If the voters are deceived by the media psy-op, they have the media´s own political leaders. Don´t forget the British politics today. The media distracted the election process, and it opened the lid for political eunuchs to come out from the bottomless pit. Currently, the UK is navigating the ocean without map and compass. If the Americans are ensnared by the media psy-op, no way to take back sovereignty and hand down Pax Americana to the next generation.</p>
<p>To my view, Trump is the last card for America.</p>
