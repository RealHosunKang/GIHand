Title: We are oblivious of the inflation seeping underground.</h1>
<p><br>
  Looking at Graph 1, inflation is not expected in the US, the UK, and the EA. Moving to the<br>
  much shorter-term interest rates in Graphs 2 &amp; 3, the market does not expect the rate rise in<br>
  the near future. The media and the governments are also keeping the nose on the downside.<br>
  However, Graphs 4 and 5 show S&amp;P 500 is touching 2,100, and Brent is approaching $45. The<br>
  inflation is seeping through under the ground of the US economy. It is just invisible to the naked<br>
  eyes. The inflation of the US was 0.9% in March in Graph 6, and it is en route for the UK and the EA.<br>
  If Americans want to make money, buy stocks in the stock market, oil in the futures market, and<br>
  push Donald Trump into the White House. Market will always move one way. You can sleep well<br>
  at every night.<br>
