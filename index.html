<h1>Inflation and the  Euro</h1>
<p>written on Mar  19, 2016</p>
<p>On Mar. 10, 2016,  the ECB cut the interest rates to -0.40% for the deposit facility and 0.00% for  the main refinancing operations (MRO). Negative rate for the deposits in the  central bank has not been unusual since the Global Recession. But the zero rate  on the MRO draws the attention, because it means the ECB&nbsp;makes a 7-day  loan to the banks in the euro area (EA) for free. Why did the ECB make such an  unprecedented decision?</p>
<p>The ECB put the  heaviest weight on the unemployment rate of the EA, which was 10.3% in Jan.  2016. The EA looks like still being in the Global Recession. But the 10.3% is  over-generalizing the status quo. Let´s look at the unemployment rates of some  countries in the EA in an ascending order.</p>
<h2>Germany (4.3%),  Italy (11.5%), Portugal (12.2%), Cyprus (15.3%), Spain (20.5%), Greece (24.6%)</h2>

<p>The 10.3% is  almost the average of those 6 countries (Germany and the South 5). The  unemployment rates of Germany, Spain, and Greece are far away from the 10.3%,  and it mis-represents the status quo. With the spanning spectrum, it´s  impossible for the ECB to take into account all the 19 countries in the EA. The  ECB should put the South 5 on the top priority, and its decision gained the  consensus. If the ECB were able to keep the interest rates low till the South 5  improve the employment situation, nothing could be better. But all resources  are limited, and there is nothing free in the economy. In the end, the era of  inflation is drawing on.</p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 is  well above 2,000 now, and Brent is touching $40. The CPI of the US was 1.0%  (12-month change) in February. It is a dead cert that inflation has just  jump-started in the US, and it will arrive at the UK and the EA in turn. In  times of inflation, Germany will be in need of high interest rates. But the ECB  will be reactionary, because the South 5 still bog down in the high  unemployment rates. The ECB can´t make a policy to satisfy both Germany and the  South 5 in times of inflation. In any case, some of the countries will decide  to break away from the EA. It is the denouement, when the EA has failed in  narrowing the North-South divide. Just as the Twin Towers were built to pull  down, the euro was coined to melt down.</p>
<p>The US is in the  process of selecting a new president for 2017. If Donald Trump wins the general  election in November, the world will find out they live in a different world.  &ldquo;Build the Wall!&rdquo; is not just to construct a concrete wall paid for by Mexico.  The buzzword alludes to taking back sovereignty of America and putting up Pax  Americana. More and more people on the grass roots are nodding at the idea put  out by Trump. It´s the reason for Trump´s success so far, regardless of the  deterrents from the Stop-Trump and esp. the media. Trump is a political  tornado, and his energy level is a nuclear reactor. &nbsp;When the US stock  market digests the Trump factor for real, the investors will be more and more  bullish, and optimism will push up all the prices. Europeans are still thinking  of Trump as a shill hosting a reality show in politics. Any one, any country,  who looks down on or stands up to Trump, will pay the price.</p>
